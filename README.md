# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
 
- Designed and implemented a deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images using **transfer learning** with the **VGG16** model.  
- Built a **Sequential model** on top of VGG16, leveraging its pre-trained weights from ImageNet, and fine-tuned the last three layers to adapt to the specific task of tumor classification.  
- Incorporated **data augmentation** techniques using **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** to enhance image quality and improve model generalization.  
- Added **Dropout layers** and **Dense layers** with **ReLU** and **Softmax** activations to prevent overfitting and output probability distributions for tumor classification (pituitary, glioma, meningioma, or no tumor).  
- Utilized **TensorFlow/Keras** for model development, **NumPy** for numerical operations, and **scikit-learn** for data shuffling to ensure robust training and evaluation.  
- Achieved high accuracy in tumor detection by preprocessing MRI images to a standardized size (128x128 pixels) and normalizing pixel values for optimal model performance.  
- Demonstrated the application of **computer vision** and **deep learning** in healthcare, emphasizing the potential of AI for early diagnosis and treatment planning.  
- **Technologies used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16, PIL, NumPy, scikit-learn, data augmentation, transfer learning.  

This project showcases my expertise in deep learning, computer vision, and transfer learning, with a focus on solving critical healthcare challenges through AI-driven solutions.
